Header 1
------------
  Do I *really* need not one but **three** back ticks to create a code box?

```
test
```

R Code Chunks
======================
  
  So does the program know its a header if its underlined? just wondering only.
  
  
```{r qplot, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3, message=FALSE }

# quick summary and plot
library(ggplot2)
summary(cars)
qplot(disp, hp, data = mtcars) + geom_smooth()
#qplot(speed, dist, data = cars) + geom_smooth()

```

```{r qplot1, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3, message=FALSE }

# quick summary and plot
library(ggplot2)
summary(mtcars)
qplot(speed, dist, data = cars) + geom_smooth()

```

Now let's see. Fingers crossed
